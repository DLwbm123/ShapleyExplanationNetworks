# ShapleyExplanationNetworks
Implementation of the paper ["Shapley Explanation Networks"](https://openreview.net/forum?id=vsU0efpivw) at ICLR 2021.
Note that this repo heavily uses the experimental feature of named tensors in PyTorch. As it was really confusing to implement the ideas for the authors, we find it tremendously easier to use this feature.
## Dependencies
For running only ShapNets, one would mostly only need PyTorch and NumPy.
